LowKick simplifies running and verifying cross-platform javascript tests on command-line. 
It aims to accomplish following tasks:

  - Provide a command-line API to run cross-platform JS tests, to verify if specified web project has been tested at target environment
  - Build NodeJS tests for other platforms (See http://github.com/azer/onejs)
  - Run NodeJS tests upon a web server, providing them an API to save the results of the tests. 

Status: Under Development
